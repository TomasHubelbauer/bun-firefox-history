# Bun Firefox history

This repository hosts a Bun script meant to be run on macOS.

The script finds all Firefox instances installed in the default location and it
goes through the `places.sqlite` files of all of them, querying and displaying
the history visits for the current day.

It is here for educational purposes as a possible building block for other work.

Run using `bun .`.
